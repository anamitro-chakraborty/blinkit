🚀 Power BI Dashboard Project – Blinkit Sales Analysis 📊

I recently built an interactive Power BI dashboard focused on sales and performance analysis for Blinkit! This project was designed to provide deep insights into sales trends, outlet performance, and product ratings.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Item & Average Ratings across all outlets.

Top & Bottom 6 Performing Outlets based on Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Item & Average Ratings.

Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Item & Average Ratings analysis segmented by:

Fat Content of products

Outlet Type

Year of Establishment

Outlet Size

Outlet Location Type

Identified the Top Selling Outlet

Multiple visualizations: bar charts, pie charts, and dynamic graphs to showcase trends and comparisons

Tracked the Number of Items Sold per category/outlet

💡 This dashboard helps in making data-driven decisions, understanding customer preferences, and identifying areas for growth and optimization.
